# Hammerspoon Configuration

This is my personal [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org/) configuration. Instead of using
Lua, I chose to use [Fennel](https://fennel-lang.org/), a LISP hosted on Lua.

In addition to a few simple key-mappings, there is a module and event handler to manage the Pandora
player [Hermes](https://hermesapp.org/), and a bit of interesting configuration for the
[URLDispatcher](http://www.hammerspoon.org/Spoons/URLDispatcher.html) Spoon. I use URLDispatcher to
launch different browsers for different url patterns.
